# Frontend Deployment Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the deployment strategy for the Museum Collection Platform frontend application.

## Build Process
The application uses Vite as the build tool with the following optimizations:
- Code splitting for better performance
- Terser minification with console.log removal
- Source maps for debugging
- Optimized chunk sizes and vendor splitting

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Static Hosting (Recommended)
**Platforms:** Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, AWS S3 + CloudFront

**Steps:**
1. Build the application: `pnpm build`
2. Deploy the `dist/` folder to your chosen platform
3. Configure environment variables for API endpoints
4. Set up custom domain and SSL certificates

**Pros:**
- Fast global CDN delivery
- Automatic HTTPS
- Easy rollbacks
- Cost-effective

### Option 2: Container Deployment
**Platforms:** Docker, Kubernetes, AWS ECS

**Steps:**
1. Create Dockerfile for nginx serving static files
2. Build container image
3. Deploy to container orchestration platform
4. Configure load balancing and auto-scaling

### Option 3: Traditional Web Server
**Platforms:** Apache, Nginx, IIS

**Steps:**
1. Build the application: `pnpm build`
2. Copy `dist/` contents to web server document root
3. Configure server for SPA routing
4. Set up SSL certificates

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.yourmuseum.com
VITE_APP_NAME=Museum Collection Platform
VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
```

### Production Environment File (.env.production)
```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.yourmuseum.com
VITE_APP_NAME=Museum Collection Platform
VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Implemented Optimizations
- ✅ Code splitting by vendor, UI, forms, and utilities
- ✅ Tree shaking for unused code elimination
- ✅ Minification with Terser
- ✅ Source maps for debugging
- ✅ Optimized dependency pre-bundling

### Additional Recommendations
- Implement service worker for caching
- Add performance monitoring (Web Vitals)
- Configure CDN caching headers
- Implement lazy loading for routes
- Add image optimization

## CI/CD Pipeline Recommendations

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: Deploy Frontend
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm install -g pnpm
      - run: pnpm install
      - run: pnpm build
      - run: pnpm test
      - name: Deploy to Production
        run: # Deploy command here
```

### Quality Gates
- ✅ ESLint checks
- ✅ Build success
- ✅ Bundle size analysis
- ✅ Performance audits
- ✅ Security scans

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Recommended Tools
- **Performance:** Web Vitals, Lighthouse CI
- **Error Tracking:** Sentry, LogRocket
- **Analytics:** Google Analytics, Mixpanel
- **Uptime:** Pingdom, UptimeRobot

### Health Checks
- Application loads successfully
- API connectivity works
- Authentication flow functions
- Core features operational

## Security Considerations

### Implemented Security Measures
- ✅ Input sanitization with DOMPurify
- ✅ XSS protection in forms
- ✅ Secure environment variable handling
- ✅ HTTPS enforcement

### Additional Security Recommendations
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Add security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- Regular dependency updates
- Security scanning in CI/CD

## Rollback Strategy

### Quick Rollback Options
1. **Static Hosting:** Revert to previous deployment
2. **Container:** Deploy previous container image
3. **Traditional:** Restore previous build files

### Rollback Triggers
- Critical bugs in production
- Performance degradation
- Security vulnerabilities
- User-reported issues

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Verify environment variables
- [ ] Check API connectivity
- [ ] Review bundle size
- [ ] Validate build output

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Verify application loads
- [ ] Test core functionality
- [ ] Check error monitoring
- [ ] Validate performance metrics
- [ ] Monitor user feedback

## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- Weekly dependency updates
- Monthly security audits
- Quarterly performance reviews
- Annual architecture assessments

### Emergency Response
- 24/7 monitoring alerts
- Incident response procedures
- Communication protocols
- Recovery time objectives (RTO < 1 hour)
